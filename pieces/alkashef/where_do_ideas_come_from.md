# Where do ideas come from?

## The problem
Data science is the process of extracting value from data. It starts with a business question 
which is tackled through a series of scientific experiments on the data. Each experiment 
follows the scientific method to validate a hypothesis about the problem that the data represents.

The starting hypothesis comes from the business question, but a single experiment is rarely enough 
to answer the question. It is then the role of the data scientist to generate more hypotheses. 
*Where do hypotheses come from?* There are no handrails outside of the scientific method.

Although domain knowledge of the business problem can serve as a source for generating more 
hypotheses as well as limiting the number of hypotheses (by virtue of experience), it
does not cover the whole space of problems that data scientists need to solve. For example,
a telco operator can't collect a statistically significant sample about its customers 
behavior through surveys, in order to train and test a supervised model that works well for 
all the customer base.  

Traditional data science training focuses on the necessary -but not sufficient- subjects of 
machine learning, statistics, programming, etc. (subjects useful to conduct a scientific experiment) 
and relatively ignores creative thinking (the hypotheses that comes before the scientific method is applied).

## Recommendations
To instill creative thinking and fire data scientists imagination, academic programs focused on 
data science skills could employ these recommendations: 

- Engage the students in multidisciplinary problems.
- Push students to solve problems without any prior domain knowledge.
- When teaching scientific subjects, encourage the students to formulate the problem 
mathematically rather than just giving them the mathematical formulation and asking them to solve it.
- Train the students to reason in natural language and force them to describe their problems or results
to the lay person.
