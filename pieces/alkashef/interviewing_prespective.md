# Indirect, important, and neglected data science skills

## What has worked well in interviews?
These interview methods have proven to select good data scientist material. 
It is worth thinking about data science academic training from this perspective: 

- Ask the interviewee to solve (reason about) a very abstract problem 
or a problem they have absolutely no prior domain knowledge of.

- Ask the interviewee to explain a technical concept they know well to a lap person.

- Ask the interviewee to conduct a presentation on a data science project they implemented. 
They should go through all the phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, 
modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

- Ask the interviewee to write programs (or pseudocode) to solve small problems. This exercises should 
focus on algorithmic thinking and rigorous problem solving rather than data structures and traditional
algorithms (e.g. sorting).

- Give the interviewee a huge data set (e.g. from Kaggle) and not enough time to crush it all,
and ask them to play with it.

Aside from their data science knowledge, hiring managers want to make sure the candidate has the following soft skill set:

- Serious 
- Smart
- Independent thinker
- Out-of-the-box thinker
- Dependable 
- Continuous learner
- Passionate about the field
- Has good communication (and presentation) skills
