These are indirect, important but usually neglected data science skills especially among young data scientists:

- Markdown
- ANSI SQL
- Agile software development (specially: scum and Kanban)
- Advanced Excel skills (formulas, visualization, data validation, lookups, name manager, conditional formatting, removing duplicates)
- Git
- Programming/scripting
